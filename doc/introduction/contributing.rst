We warmly welcome contributions on our 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/>`_.

Depending on your skills and interests, 
you may help us to develop KeOps as follows:

#. **Write a bug report.**
   If you encounter a compilation issue, 
   notice a typo on this website or need
   help to accelerate your program with KeOps,
   please let us know on our `issue tracker <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues>`_.
   |br| |br|

#. **Request a new feature.**
   KeOps was first motivated by applications
   to shape analysis - but has now found
   a much wider audience.
   If your work could benefit
   from an extension of the current KeOps engine,
   please let us know about it on
   `GitHub <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues>`_.
   All suggestions are welcome!
   |br| |br|

#. **Let us know about your work.**
   We are always happy to learn about
   new use cases for KeOps.
   If you are using this library in your
   work or simply believe that it could be
   helpful, feel free to contact us on 
   `GitHub <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues>`_. 
   |br| |br|

#. **Write a new tutorial.**
   As detailed in our :doc:`introduction <why_using_keops>`,
   KeOps can be used in a wide range of settings...
   and we'd love this documentation to better reflect 
   its flexibility.
   In order to add a new example or tutorial to this website, 
   you should simply write a new Python file in
   the `pykeops/tutorials <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/tree/main/pykeops/tutorials>`_
   or `pykeops/examples <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/tree/main/pykeops/examples>`_
   folders with 
   `detailed comments <https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html>`_
   and submit your `pull request <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/pulls>`_.
   From imaging sciences to computational physics,
   all contributions all welcome!

#. **Write a new maths operation.**
   As detailed in the :doc:`guided tour <../formulas/math_operations>`
   of our C++ engine, KeOps
   is fairly easy to extend with custom operations
   and reductions.
   If you find these instructions unclear, please let us know.
   |br| |br|


#. **Write a KeOps interface for a new language or framework.**
   KeOps is mostly written in C++ and thus relatively
   easy to interface with all modern languages.
   We currently support PyTorch and NumPy
   while providing partial binders for Matlab.
   The RKeOps package is developed by 
   `Ghislain Durif <https://gdurif.perso.math.cnrs.fr/>`_
   and we warmly welcome external contributions
   for e.g. `Julia <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues/144>`_ 
   or `TensorFlow <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues/135>`_ bindings:
   if you'd like to interface KeOps with your
   favorite library, feel free to contact us on 
   `GitHub <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/issues>`_. 
   |br| |br|


#. **Contribute to the core KeOps engine.**
   Finally, you may contribute directly with
   a major "original" feature, such as the 
   :doc:`on-GPU conjugate gradient solvers <../_auto_benchmarks/plot_benchmark_invkernel>`
   that were implemented by `Tanguy Lefort <https://github.com/tanglef>`_.
   A few suggestions are detailed on our
   GitHub `projects page <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/projects>`_:
   if you are interested in such a project,
   please let us know. We'll be happy to help
   you to choose an appropriate topic and discuss
   possible collaborations.
