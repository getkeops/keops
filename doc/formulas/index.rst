========================
Generic formulas
========================

The two previous sections have highlighted the need for **efficient
Map-Reduce GPU routines** in data sciences. To complete our guided tour of
the inner workings of the KeOps library, we now explain how
**generic reductions and formulas** are encoded within our codebase.


Note that this section is extracted
from the Chapter 2.2 of Jean Feydy's 
`PhD thesis <https://www.jeanfeydy.com/geometric_data_analysis.pdf>`_.
