Python install
##############

PyKeOps is a **Python 3 wrapper** around the low-level KeOps library, which is written in **C++/CUDA**. 
It provides functions that can be used in any **NumPy** or **PyTorch** script.

Requirements
============

- **Python 3** with packages **numpy**.
- A C++ compiler compatible with std=c++14: **g++** version >=7 or **clang++** version >=8.
- The **Cmake** build system, version >= 3.10.
- The **Cuda** toolkit, including the **nvcc** compiler (optional): version >=10.0 is recommended. Make sure that your C++ compiler is compatible with the installed nvcc.
- **PyTorch** (optional): version >= 1.5.


Using pip (recommended)
=======================

1. Just in case: in a terminal, check the **consistency** of the outputs of the commands ``which python``, ``python --version``, ``which pip`` and ``pip --version``. 

2. In a terminal, type:

  .. code-block:: bash

    pip install pykeops

  Note that compiled shared objects (``*.so`` files) will be stored in the folder  ``~/.cache/libkeops-$version``, where ``~`` is the path to your home folder and ``$version`` is the package version number.

3. Test your installation, as described in the :ref:`next section <part.checkPython>`.

On Google Colab
===============

Google provides free virtual machines where KeOps runs
out-of-the-box. 
In a new `Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com>`_, typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    !pip install pykeops[colab] > install.log

should allow you to get a working version of KeOps in less than twenty seconds.


From source using git
=====================


The simplest way of installing a specific version
of KeOps is to use `some advanced pip syntax <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git>`_:


.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/getkeops/keops.git@master


Alternatively, you may:

1. Clone the KeOps repo at a location of your choice (denoted here as ``/path/to``):

  .. code-block:: console

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/getkeops/keops.git /path/to/libkeops

  Note that compiled **.so** routines will be stored in the folder ``/path/to/libkeops/pykeops/build``: this directory must have **write permission**. 


2. Manually add the directory ``/path/to/libkeops`` (and **not** ``/path/to/libkeops/pykeops/``) to your python path.
   
  + This can be done once and for all, by adding the path to to your ``~/.bashrc``. In a terminal, type:
        
    .. code-block:: bash

      echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/libkeops/" >> ~/.bashrc

  + Otherwise, you may add the following line to the beginning of your python scripts:
    
    .. code-block:: python

      import os.path
      import sys
      sys.path.append('/path/to/libkeops')

3. Test your installation, as described in the :ref:`next section. <part.checkPython>`


.. _`part.checkPython`:

Testing your installation
=========================

You can use the following test functions to compile and run simple KeOps formulas. If the compilation fails, it returns the full log.

1.  In a python terminal, 

  .. code-block:: python

    import pykeops
    pykeops.clean_pykeops()          # just in case old build files are still present 
    pykeops.test_numpy_bindings()    # perform the compilation
        
  should return:

  .. code-block:: console

    Compiling libKeOpsnumpyb10acd1892 in /path/to/build_dir/build-libKeOpsnumpyb10acd1892:
       formula: Sum_Reduction(SqNorm2(x - y),1)
       aliases: x = Vi(0,3); y = Vj(1,3); 
       dtype  : float64
    ... Done.
    
    pyKeOps with numpy bindings is working!

2. If you use PyTorch, the following code:

  .. code-block:: python

    import pykeops
    pykeops.clean_pykeops()          # just in case old build files are still present
    pykeops.test_torch_bindings()    # perform the compilation
  
  should return:

  .. code-block:: console

    Compiling libKeOpstorch2ee7a43993 in /path/to/build_dir/build-libKeOpstorch2ee7a43993:
       formula: Sum_Reduction(SqNorm2(x - y),1)
       aliases: x = Vi(0,3); y = Vj(1,3); 
       dtype  : float32
    ... Done.

    pyKeOps with torch bindings is working!


Troubleshooting
===============

Compilation issues
------------------

First of all, make sure that you are using a C++ compiler which is compatible with the **C++11 revision** and/or your **nvcc** (CUDA) compiler. Otherwise, compilation of formulas may fail in unexpected ways. A table of supported combinations is available at `this address <https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132>`_. Depending on your system, you can:

1. Install a compiler **system-wide**: for instance, on Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install g++ with apt and then use `update-alternatives <https://askubuntu.com/questions/26498/choose-gcc-and-g-version>`_ to choose a suitable compiler as default. Don't forget to pick compatible versions for both **gcc** and **g++**.  

2. Install a compiler **locally**: if you are using a conda environment, you can install a new instance of gcc and g++ by following the `documentation of conda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/build-packages/compiler-tools.html>`_.


.. _`part.cache`:

Cache directory
---------------

If you experience problems with compilation, it may be a good idea to **flush the build folder** that KeOps uses as a cache for already-compiled formulas. To do this, just type:

.. code-block:: python

  import pykeops
  pykeops.clean_pykeops()

You can change the build folder by using the ``set_build_folder()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

  import pykeops
  print(pykeops.config.bin_folder)  # display default build_folder
  pykeops.set_bin_folder("/my/new/location")  # change the build folder
  print(pykeops.config.bin_folder)  # display new build_folder


.. warning::
    The ``build_folder`` variable must be changed at the beginning of a Python session.
    That is, **before** importing any pykeops modules.



Verbosity level
---------------

To help debugging, you can activate a **verbose** compilation mode. This can be done by stting the environment variable `PYKEOPS_VERBOSE` to 1. In a terminal, type:

.. code-block:: bash

  export PYKEOPS_VERBOSE=1
  python my_script_calling_pykeops.py

Alternatively, you can enable verbose compilation from your python script by setting the flag ``pykeops.verbose`` to ``True`` **after** your KeOps imports. In a python shell, type:

.. code-block:: python

  import pykeops
  pykeops.config.verbose = True


Build type
----------

To force the (re)compilation of KeOps shared objects, you can change the KeOps build type from ``Release`` (default) to ``Debug``. This is done by changing the value of the environment variable ``PYKEOPS_BUILD_TYPE``, either in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  export PYKEOPS_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"
  python my_script_calling_pykeops.py

Or directly in your python script, altering the value of the (string) variable ``pykeops.build_type`` right **after** your KeOps imports. In a python shell, simply type: 

.. code-block:: python

  import pykeops
  pykeops.config.build_type = 'Debug'

.. warning::
  Beware! The shared objects generated in debug mode are **not optimized for speed**
  and should thus be deleted at the end of your debugging session. 
  In order to do so, please **flush your cache directory** as described in the :ref:`previous section <part.cache>`.
