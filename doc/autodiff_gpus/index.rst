Autodiff and GPUs
=================

Before presenting the inner workings
of KeOps, we **recap briefly the main rules
of GPU programming and automatic differentiation**.
This short introduction will, hopefully,
allow readers to understand the
capabilities and limitations of these (remarkable) tools.

Note that this section is extracted
from the Chapter 2.1 of Jean Feydy's 
`PhD thesis <https://www.jeanfeydy.com/geometric_data_analysis.pdf>`_.
