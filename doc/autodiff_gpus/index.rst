Autodiff and GPUs
=================

Before presenting the inner workings
of KeOps, we **recap briefly the main rules
of GPU programming and automatic differentiation**.
This short introduction will, hopefully,
allow readers to understand the
capabilities and limitations of these (remarkable) tools.

Note that this section is extracted
from the Chapter 2.1 of Jean Feydy's PhD thesis,
to be available soon.
