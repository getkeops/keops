Kernel Operations on the GPU, with autodiff, without memory overflows
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The KeOps library lets you compute reductions of **large arrays** 
whose entries are given by a **mathematical formula** or a **neural network**. 
It combines **efficient C++ routines** with an **automatic differentiation** 
engine and can be used with **Python** (NumPy, PyTorch), **Matlab** and **R**.

It is perfectly suited to the computation of **kernel** matrix-vector products,
**K-nearest neighbors** queries, **N-body** interactions,
point cloud **convolutions** and the associated **gradients**.
Crucially, it performs well even when the corresponding kernel or distance 
matrices do *not* fit into the RAM or GPU memory.
Compared with a PyTorch GPU baseline, KeOps provides
a **x10-x100 speed-up** on a wide range of geometric applications,
from kernel methods to geometric deep learning.

**Why using KeOps?**
Math libraries represent most objects as matrices and tensors:

- **(a) Dense matrices.** Variables are often encoded as
  dense numerical arrays :math:`(M_{i,j}) = (M[i,j]) \in \mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{M}\times\mathrm{N}}`.
  This representation is convenient and well-supported,
  but also puts a **heavy load** on the memories of our computers.
  Unfortunately, **large arrays are cumbersome** to move around and
  may not even fit in RAM or GPU memories.

  In practice, this means that a majority of scientific programs are **memory-bound**.
  Run times for most neural networks and mathematical computations
  are not limited by the raw capabilities of our CPUs and CUDA cores,
  but by the **time-consuming transfers** of large arrays
  from memory circuits to arithmetic computing units.

- **(b) Sparse matrices.** To work around this problem, a common solution is to rely on
  sparse matrices: tensors that have few non-zero coefficients.
  We represent these objects using lists of indices
  :math:`(i_n,j_n)` and values :math:`M_n = M_{i_n,j_n}`
  that correspond to a small number of non-zero entries.
  Matrix-vector operations are then implemented with
  indexing methods and scattered memory accesses.

  This method is elegant and allows us to represent large arrays 
  with a small memory footprint.
  But unfortunately, it **does not stream well on GPUs**:
  parallel computing devices are wired to perform *block-wise* memory accesses
  and have a hard time dealing with lists of *random* indices :math:`(i_n,j_n)`.
  As a consequence, when compared with dense arrays,
  sparse encodings only speed up computations for matrices
  that have **less than 1% non-zero coefficients**. 
  This restriction prevents sparse matrices 
  from being truly useful outside of graph and mesh processing.

- **(c) Symbolic matrices.**
  KeOps provides another solution to **speed up tensor programs**.
  Our key remark is that most of the large arrays that are used
  in machine learning and applied mathematics share a **common mathematical structure**.
  *Distance* matrices, *kernel* matrices, point cloud *convolutions*
  and *attention* layers can all be described as **symbolic** tensors:
  given two collections of vectors :math:`(x_i)` and :math:`(y_j)`,
  their coefficients :math:`M_{i,j}` at location :math:`(i,j)` are given by
  **mathematical formulas** :math:`F(x_i,y_j)`
  that are evaluated on data samples :math:`x_i` and :math:`y_j`.

  These objects are not "sparse" in the traditional sense...
  but can nevertheless be described efficiently using
  a mathematical formula :math:`F` and relatively
  small data arrays :math:`(x_i)` and :math:`(y_j)`.
  The main purpose of the KeOps library
  is to provide support for this abstraction
  **with all the perks of a deep learning library**:

  - A transparent :doc:`interface <python/api/common/index>` with CPU and GPU integration.
  - Numerous :doc:`tutorials <_auto_tutorials/index>` and :doc:`benchmarks <_auto_benchmarks/index>`.
  - Full support for **automatic differentiation**, **batch processing**
    and approximate computations.
  

In practice, KeOps symbolic tensors are both
**fast** and **memory-efficient**.
We take advantage of the structure of CUDA registers
to bypass costly memory transfers between
arithmetic units and memory circuits. This allows us to provide a
**x10-x100 speed-up** to PyTorch GPU programs
in a wide range of settings.

Using our **Python interface**, a typical sample of code looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create two arrays with 3 columns and a (huge) number of lines, on the GPU
    import torch  # NumPy, Matlab and R are also supported
    M, N, D = 1000000, 2000000, 3
    x = torch.randn(M, D, requires_grad=True).cuda()  # x.shape = (1e6, 3)
    y = torch.randn(N, D).cuda()                      # y.shape = (2e6, 3)

    # Turn our dense Tensors into KeOps symbolic variables with "virtual"
    # dimensions at positions 0 and 1 (for "i" and "j" indices):
    from pykeops.torch import LazyTensor
    x_i = LazyTensor(x.view(M, 1, D))  # x_i.shape = (1e6, 1, 3)
    y_j = LazyTensor(y.view(1, N, D))  # y_j.shape = ( 1, 2e6,3)

    # We can now perform large-scale computations, without memory overflows:
    D_ij = ((x_i - y_j)**2).sum(dim=2)  # Symbolic (1e6,2e6,1) matrix of squared distances
    K_ij = (- D_ij).exp()               # Symbolic (1e6,2e6,1) Gaussian kernel matrix

    # We come back to vanilla PyTorch Tensors or NumPy arrays using
    # reduction operations such as .sum(), .logsumexp() or .argmin()
    # on one of the two "symbolic" dimensions 0 and 1.
    # Here, the kernel density estimation   a_i = sum_j exp(-|x_i-y_j|^2)
    # is computed using a CUDA scheme that has a linear memory footprint and
    # outperforms standard PyTorch implementations by two orders of magnitude.
    a_i = K_ij.sum(dim=1)  # Genuine torch.cuda.FloatTensor, a_i.shape = (1e6, 1), 

    # Crucially, KeOps fully supports automatic differentiation!
    g_x = torch.autograd.grad((a_i ** 2).sum(), [x])

KeOps allows you to **get the most out of your hardware** without compromising on **usability**.
It provides:

* **Linear** (instead of quadratic) **memory footprint** for numerous types of computations.
* Support for a wide range of mathematical **formulas** that can be composed at will.
* Seamless computation of **derivatives** and **gradients**, up to arbitrary orders.
* Sum, LogSumExp, Min, Max but also ArgMin, ArgMax or K-min **reductions**.
* A **conjugate gradient solver** for large-scale spline interpolation and Gaussian process regression.
* Transparent integration with **standard packages**, such as the
  `SciPy solvers <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html>`_ for linear algebra.
* An interface for **block-sparse** and coarse-to-fine strategies.
* Support for **multi GPU** configurations.
